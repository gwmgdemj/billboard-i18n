Community Internationalization for Billboard Standby Screen
===========================================================

See http://thp.io/2012/billboard/ for project information

If you want to contribute:

  1. Download the most recent en.ts
  2. Copy the file as XX.ts where XX is the ISO 639-1 code for your language
     (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes)
  3. Use Qt Linguist to translate the file
     (install Qt SDK or use http://code.google.com/p/qtlinguistdownload/) or
     install package `qttools5-dev-tools` on Debian.
  4. Submit the translation as pull request

By submitting the translation you agree to release the translation under the
ISC license (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license):

    Copyright (c) 2013 <Your Name>

    Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any
    purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above

    WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN
    ACTION OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR
    IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

As Billboard is closed source at the moment, this will allow usage of the
translations in Billboard right now, as well as allow the translation to be
used when Billboard is open sourced at some point in the future.
